# Hello 👋

🎓 I’m a graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a B.A. in Psychology and a minor in Statistics. I'm passionate about the intersection of psychology and data, with interests in data analysis, project management, and human resources—especially how data-driven insights can support more inclusive and effective organizational practices.

📊 My work focuses on exploring how union membership rates have changed over time across education levels, industries, gender, and employment sectors. Using linear regression models, I analyze trends and their implications for compensation strategies in HR.

🛠️ Skilled in MATLAB, R, Python, and qualitative coding methods. 

📂 In my STAT 155: Methods in Data Science project, I investigate how union membership rates vary by education level, industry, gender, and employment sector from 1973 to 2024. You can view the full repository here: [STAT 155 Repository](https://github.com/nalucasucsc/stat155)
