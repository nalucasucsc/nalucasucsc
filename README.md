# Hello 👋

🎓 I am a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a bachelor of arts in Psychology and a Statistics minor. I am passionate about the intersection of psychology, and data. My interests include **data analysis**, **project management**, and **human resources**—especially how data-driven insights can support more inclusive and effective organizational practices.

📊 Here is where I will be sharing my code, research, and analsis of how union vs. nonunion wage gaps influence compensation strategies in HR through linear regression models.

🛠️ Experienced in MATLAB, R, Python, and qualitative coding methods

Check out my STAT 155 repository where I investigate how union membership rates differ across education levels, industries, gender, and employment sectors from 1973 to 2024.
